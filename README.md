## Preface

This is one of my old Roblox experiments, which usually suck, but this one is one of the best, so I figured I would put it here to show some Lua. Don't expect anything pristine though. Files are large, nesting is unhinged and you'll be lucky to find comments. I also included the place file because the tool I used to extract all the scripts doesn't extract all blocks, GUI, etc.

I used [rbxlx-to-rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbxlx-to-rojo) to get all the files, but the actual game wasn't written with Rojo. But, you are free to link the place file and the scripts.

## Description

A block building Roblox game. It also has an admin panel for some reason.

## Game footage

I took the liberty of recording some of the features.
